# Contributing to bitcoin.rocks
Thank you for considering contributing to bitcoin.rocks! Please review this document before submitting a pull request.

## Pull requests
Before you spend your time working on a significant new feature, please first create [a feature request.](https://github.com/sovenor/bitcoin-rocks/discussions/new?category=ideas)

This will prevent you from having a pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

If you wish to work on a translation, please follow our Translations guide below.

## Translations
All contributions are welcome, but we currently have a strong focus on translations. Here's a simple guide to get started on your translation:

### 1. Fork and create a branch
Fork the repo and create a branch with the name of the language you wish to translate.

### 2. Duplicate the entire "en" folder
The default language on bitcoin.rocks is English, so all of the master content lives within the "en" folder.

Duplicate this folder and rename it with the [2 letter language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) that corresponds to your language.

### 3. Translate the content within the .html files
Now you can begin to translate the content from English to your preferred language. Simply swap the English content within the .html files with content in your preferred language.

Please do not change any of the actual HTML content, classes, or IDs. Only replace the English text with your translated text.

In order to have your translation approved and merged into the main branch, you must translate the minimum required pages. Below is a list of the minimum required pages and a complete list of all pages on the website for a complete translation.

#### Minimum required pages for translation
/404.html  
/bank-runs.html  
/bitcoin-vs-cbdc.html  
/bitcoin-vs-gold.html  
/compound-inflation-calculator.html  
/get-involved.html  
/index.html (homepage)  
/inflation.html (You only need to translate the currency sections that a user who speaks your langauge would be interested in.)  
/lightning.html  
/stickers.html  
/wallets.html  

#### Additional pages for complete translation
Here are all the pages that exist on the website. Translate all of these for a complete translation, or just tackle one section at a time.

##### Business pages
/business/accounting.html  
/business/faq.html  
/business/guide.html  
/business/index.html  
/business/kit-success.html  
/business/kit.html  
/business/maps-success.html  
/business/maps.html  
/business/sticker-language-success.html  
/business/sticker-success.html  
/business/stickers.html  
/business/wallets.html  
/business/why.html  

##### Nostr pages
/nostr/index.html  
/nostr/what-is-nostr.html  

##### News pages
/news/energy/bitcoin-mining-stabilizes-texas-power-grid.html  
/news/environment/bitcoin-mining-cleaning-up-coal-dumps-usa-pennsylvania.html  

##### Sticker files pages
/sticker-files/index.html  
/sticker-files/[your-language]/index.html  

There is no need to translate the other sticker-files pages into your language, since users who speak your language will only be looking for files in that language.

For example, a Spanish translation only needs to translate /sticker-files/spanish/index.html

##### Other pages
/postcards.html  

##### Success pages
/postcard-success.html  
/sticker-language-success.html  
/sticker-success.html  

### 4. Submit a pull request
After you've finished your translation and pushed your changes to your fork, it's time to submit a pull request.

Currently, all pull requests are reviewed by [sovenor](https://github.com/sovenor)
