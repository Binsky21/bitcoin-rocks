bitcoin.rocks is an educational website designed for people who are new to bitcoin.

The website is written in raw HTML / CSS / JS. This is easiest for me to work in and eliminates the burden of a CMS.

The latest merged code is uploaded on https://bitcoin.rocks/

The server handles redirects and removing ".html" from links.
